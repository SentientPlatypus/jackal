<h3 align="center">Jackal</h3>

  <p align="center">
    In the verifiable robotics research group at Cornell, our goal is to develop a robot that helps evacuate people out of buildings. our robot, named jackal has been used in pilot studies studying human-robot interaction when there are contradicting values. For example, in an emergency, people will often search for their valuables before exiting the building, thus decreasing their chances of survival. The robot on the other hand, will want to exit the building. We are studying the best robot behaviors to get the people to follow it faster.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I worked bloating the walls. This step ensures that the robot does not run into walls. I do this by taking the walls and sort of "bloating" them and telling the robot those bloated walls are the real walls. Additionally, I worked on creating a ROS node for projecting a human position onto the a predetermined roadmap so the robot can go to it.

This is bloating:

This is projecting a human onto the roadmap:
